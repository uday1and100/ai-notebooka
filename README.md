DEVELOP SOFTWARE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS/AI Agents FOR THE FOLLOWING USE STORY

User Story

Smart Retail Operations Platform

As a warehouse supervisor at a retail company, I want a simple inventory classification tool that helps me categorize items into A, B, and C groups based on their value contribution, so that I can prioritize stock management and focus on high-value items without needing advanced analytics.

Objective

To develop a basic software module that enables retail inventory teams to classify products using ABC analysis and manage them accordingly.

ABC Classification Logic

A items: High-value, low-quantity items (e.g., premium electronics) - require tight control and frequent review.

B items: Moderate value and quantity managed with regular monitoring.

C items: Low-value, high-quantity items (eg, accessories) - managed with minimal oversight.

Key Features

1. Rule Engine: To set rules to classify the items into A/B/C category

2. Manual Data Entry: Users can input item name, quantity, and unit cost.

3. Automatic Classification: System assigns A/B/C category for the items

4. Item Threshold: The parameter screen allows entry of the minimum inventory level for initiating reorders and the maximum inventory level at which no further ordering will be made for each category.

5. Dashboard: Displays categorized items with filters and summary totals.

6. Export Option: Download categorized inventory as CSV or PDF for offline use.

Benefits

Helps prioritize inventory control without complex systems.

Reduces overstocking of low-value items.

Improves focus on high-impact inventory.

Instructions

Use Al tools or Build Your Own Al Agents (BYOAA) to develop the software and deliverables

Deliverables are expected to be of production-level quality, ensuring excellence in both content and look & feel.

Selection of Tools: Carefully evaluate and select the most suitable Al tools or frameworks for each phase of the project. If building custom Al agents, ensure they are scalable, maintainable. Additional weightage will be given if team builds their own Al agent to create the deliverables.

Quality Standards: Adhere strictly to coding standards and best practices for software development. Apply consistent design patterns, code reviews, and automated testing to maintain high quality.

Integration: Ensure seamless integration of components with the overall application architecture. Validate interoperability with existing systems and databases

Testing: Prepare comprehensive test cases, including both functional and non-functional scenarios.

Documentation: Maintain clear and detailed documentation for all deliverables, including architecture diagrams, data models, and user manuals. Update documents regularly as changes are made.

User Experience: Prioritise a user-centric approach in UI/UX design. Avoid using Streamlit or Gradio for the user interface.
